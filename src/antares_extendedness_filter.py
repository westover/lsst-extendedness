"""
ANTARES Level 2 Filter for LSST Alerts
Filters based on DIASource extendedness values and SSSource presence/reassociation

This filter captures:
1. New DIASources that match extendedness criteria and SSSource requirements
2. DIASources that were recently reassociated with an SSObject (even if previously seen)

The reassociation detection works by checking if ssObjectReassocTimeMjdTai is recent
relative to the observation time, indicating a fresh association update.

NOTE: This filter only determines which alerts PASS through to the output Kafka topic.
It does NOT modify or control which fields are included in the alert packets.
All fields in the original LSST alert packet (including ssObjectId, ssObjectReassocTimeMjdTai,
trail* flags, and pixelFlags* fields) are automatically included in alerts that pass the filter.

The downstream consumer (lsst_alert_consumer.py) is responsible for extracting
these fields from the alert packets and storing them in CSV files.

def extendedness_filter(locus):
    """
    ANTARES filter function that filters alerts based on extendedness criteria,
    SSSource presence, and recent reassociations.
    
    This filter checks:
    1. extendednessMedian, extendednessMin, and extendednessMax from DIASource table
    2. Presence of SSSource schema (regardless of values)
    3. Recent SSObject reassociation (ssObjectReassocTimeMjdTai close to observation time)
    
    You'll need to configure the threshold values based on your science case.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    locus : antares.devkit.locus.Locus
        ANTARES locus object containing alert information
        
    Returns:
    --------
    bool
        True if the alert passes the filter, False otherwise
